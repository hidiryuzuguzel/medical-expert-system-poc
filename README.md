# Medical Expert System
Proof-of-concept (POC) of a medical diagnosis system using a probabilistic expert system, which is based on Noisy-or Bayesian Network Model. In the model, diseases and symptoms are represented as binary variables, and diseases interact to produce symptoms via a noisy-or-gate. The code is written using Numpy library.
